Initialization calls may appear to be successful when, in reality, they\n have no effect and leave the clone uninitialized, allowing a third party to initialize it later.\n NOTE: Using a non-zero value at creation will require the contract using this function (e.g. a factory)\n to always have enough balance for new deployments.

A clone that points to an address\n without code cannot be initialized.

These are provided through `args` and cannot be changed after deployment. To\n access the arguments within the implementation, use {fetchCloneArgs}.\n This function uses the create2 opcode and a `salt` to deterministically deploy the clone. Using the same\n `implementation`, `args` and `salt` multiple times will revert, since the clones cannot be deployed twice\n at the same address.\n WARNING: This function does not check if `implementation` has code. A clone that points to an address\n without code cannot be initialized. Initialization calls may appear to be successful when, in reality, they\n have no effect and leave the clone uninitialized, allowing a third party to initialize it later."
